- Upgrade DAML code generation to use latest version.
- Model changes to augment the CDM product coverage for securities

    Additional attributes added to `Execution`:
	1.  `Quantity` - used to specify the transacted amount and units.
	2.  `Price` – used to specify the price, accrued interest and traded currency. This initial implementation models the transacted dirty price as the `netPrice`  attribute, and models the difference between the clean and dirty prices as the `accruedInterest` attribute.
	3.  `SettlementTerms` – used to specify the settlement amount and currency.

	Data rules added to validate the `Execution` object for security transactions:
	1.  Validate `partyRole` contains party references for both `PartyRoleEnum.Buyer` and `PartyRoleEnum.Seller`.
	2.  Validate `partyRole` contains party references for both `PartyRoleEnum.ExecutingEntity` and `PartyRoleEnum.Counterparty`.
	3.  Validate `Quantity`, `Price` and `SettlementTerms` exists.
